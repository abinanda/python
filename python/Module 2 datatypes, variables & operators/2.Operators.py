# Operators

### A. Write an equation which relates 399, 543, and 12345 

# One of the possible solution is, if 12345 is divided by 543 we get a 
# remainder as 399 and quotient as 22.

a = 399 
b = 543
c = 12345

equation = 22 * b + a
print(equation)

equation == c

# Hence it is valid relation



### B. "When I divide 5 with 3, I got 1. But when I divide -5 with 3, I got -2‚Äù
# How would you justify it.

# Divide 5 by 3 using integer division
result1 = 5 // 3
print(result1)  # Output: 1


# Divide -5 by 3 using integer division
result2 = -5 // 3
print(result2)  # Output: -2



 

### 2. a = 5, b = 3, c = 10. What will be the output of the following:

 # A. a/=b
 # B. c*=5  

# Solution:
a = 5
b = 3
c = 10

## A. a/=b

a = a / b
print(a)

##  B. c*=5  

c = c * 5
print(c)


### 3.A. How to check the presence of an alphabet "s" in word "Data Science".

word = "Data Science"
word.find("S")

### 3.B. How can you obtain 64 by using number 4 and 3.

# 64 is cube of 4
a = 4 ** 3
print(a)
